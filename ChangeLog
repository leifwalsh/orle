	* tests/unittest.h: rewrote unittest framework to collect
	assertions

	* tests/: moved tests into subsystem subdirs, added useless io
	test

	* rle/rle-io.c (rle_encode_fd): wrote file descriptor wrapper
	(rle_decode_fd): wrote file descriptor wrapper
	(rle_encode_file): wrote ineffective file encoder/decoder
	(rle_decode_file): wrote ineffective file encoder/decoder

	* rle/rle-io.h: added file io API

	* tests/simple.c (main): allow for slight growth in bad cases

	* tests/easy.c (main): allow for slight growth in bad cases

	* rle/rle.c (rle_encode_bytes): prevent space doubling with a
	better algorithm
	(rle_decode_bytes): prevent space doubling

	* rle/rle-debug.h (DBG): better debug print format

	* tests/osc.c (main): wrote test to check for bad behavior

	* tests/simple.c (main): change variable name

	* tests/easy.c (main): change variable name

	* Makefile.am (librle_@RLE_API_VERSION@_la_CFLAGS): fix flag setting

	* rle/rle.c (rle_encode_bytes): Implemented simple (worst case 2n) encoder
	(rle_decode_bytes): Implemented simple decoder

	* Makefile.am: set library visibility, make libtool build real
	binaries for tests

	* configure.ac: make build system silent

	* tests/simple.c (main): update old test to use unit test
	framework

	* tests/easy.c (main): create test that verifies a really easy
	buffer does get compressed (it doesn't yet)

	* tests/unittest.h (expect): create unit test framework, doesn't
	do much yet
